# Sandpiles

Source code used for generating [Sandpiles on La Chaine des Poubelles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEXNqBxSdHw).

## Python implementation

Under the /python/ directory, it was used to generate the .avi files containing the animation.

Run the `main_filesplitting.py` file to avoid being limited by the 4GB limit of .avi files in OpenCV.

In the repo directory, `python main_filesplitting.py`

It was __very__ slow, next time I'll probably use node.js or C++.

## JavaScript implementation

[Live demo here](https://ninivert.github.io/Sandpiles/)

Under the /docs/ directory, hosted with GitHub pages.
